# Overview
This is a calculator that was created following the guidelines outlined by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about) in the [final project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) for their fundamentals course.

This readme contains several sections:
1. How to use
2. Problem
    * This includes the details regarding the project and my re-explanation into my own words of what is expected.
3. Process
    * This includes the steps taken to solve the problem (more so of my organization before I start each sub problem + and through iterations)
    * Also includes algorithms and any overview + explanation, along with any pseudocode I felt was necessary before coding to solve each sub problem.

# How to use

# Problem
## Calculator UI
To create a calculator, several crutial elements are required. These include:
1. Number buttons 0-9
2. An add button
3. A subtract button
4. A multiply button
5. A divide button
6. An equals button
7. A display window
7. *A decimal button*\*
8. *A clear/ clear all button*\*\
9. *+/- button*\*\
<small><small>* All though not required, these are fairly essential to have if this calculator is to be reliable.</small></small>


# Steps
## 1. Calculator UI
To start, a simple UI (to start) should be created fulfilling all the requirements outlined in the `Problem` section for this sub problem. From there, functionality can then slowly be added in. To do this, the base HTML will need to be created first, along with a simple linked style sheet. Styling will be improved on towards the end once all functionality has been added. 

In regards to styling, I considered using a grid system for the buttons, and although this would make more sense, I was having issues centering the text in each button without causing other issues. Due to this, and also because I want to improve on working with flex, I used flex-wrap in combination with width %s to ensure every button was the same size.
