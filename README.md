# Overview
This is a calculator that was created following the guidelines outlined by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about) in the [final project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) for their fundamentals course.

This readme contains several sections:
1. How to use
2. Problem
    * This includes the details regarding the project and my re-explanation into my own words of what is expected.
3. Process
    * This includes the steps taken to solve the problem (more so of my organization before I start + and through iterations)
    * Also includes algorithms and any overview + explanation, along with any pseudocode I felt was necessary before coding those sub problems.
